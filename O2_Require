A more complex model to estimate oxygen (O₂) requirements often incorporates factors such as basal metabolic rate (BMR), activity level, heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO₂), and ventilation (VE). Here’s a general framework you can consider:
1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

BMR can be estimated using formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation:

    For Men:
    BMR=88.362+(13.397×weight in kg)+(4.799×height in cm)−(5.677×age in years)
    BMR=88.362+(13.397×weight in kg)+(4.799×height in cm)−(5.677×age in years)

    For Women:
    BMR=447.593+(9.247×weight in kg)+(3.098×height in cm)−(4.330×age in years)
    BMR=447.593+(9.247×weight in kg)+(3.098×height in cm)−(4.330×age in years)

2. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

Multiply BMR by an activity factor based on the individual’s lifestyle (sedentary, active, etc.).
3. Oxygen Consumption (VO₂)

VO₂ can be calculated as:
VO2=TDEEcaloric equivalent of O2
VO2​=caloric equivalent of O2​TDEE​

Where the caloric equivalent of O₂ is approximately 5 kcal/L.
4. Heart Rate and SpO₂ Relationship

You can integrate HR and SpO₂ into the VO₂ calculation:
O2 requirement (mL/min)=HR×SV×(CaO2−CvO2)
O2​ requirement (mL/min)=HR×SV×(CaO2​−CvO2​)

Where:

    SV = Stroke Volume (amount of blood pumped per heartbeat)
    CaO₂ = Arterial oxygen content
    CvO₂ = Venous oxygen content

Oxygen content can be calculated as:
CaO2=(1.34×Hb×SpO2)+(0.003×PaO2)
CaO2​=(1.34×Hb×SpO2​)+(0.003×PaO2​)

Where:

    Hb = Hemoglobin concentration (g/dL)
    PaO₂ = Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (mmHg)

5. Ventilation (VE)

Calculate ventilation based on the O₂ requirement:
VE=O2 requirementFiO2−FEO2
VE=FiO2​−FEO​2O2​ requirement​

Where:

    FiO₂ = Fraction of inspired oxygen (usually around 0.21 for room air)
    FE_O2 = Fraction of expired oxygen

Summary

This complex model requires accurate physiological data, including heart rate, stroke volume, hemoglobin levels, and more, to estimate O₂ requirements effectively. In clinical settings, advanced monitoring equipment or laboratory tests may be used for precise calculations.
Limitations

    The model can be quite complex and not practical for everyday use without proper tools.
    Individual variations can significantly influence O₂ requirements, making real-time monitoring essential for accurate assessments.
